# AutoIt_MySQL
The MySQL UDF created by prog@ndy

These UDFs allow access to MySQL databases without the installation of ODBC drivers. This only requires a DLL, which was originally included in the download.

Originally this collection also contained the libmysqll.dll for 32bit and 64bit. For licensing reasons, these files are to be downloaded directly from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/.
Download the MySQL Connector 32/64bit zip archive and extract the dll file.

When using MySQL, the license conditions of the provider must be observed.
